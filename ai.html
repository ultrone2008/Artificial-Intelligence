<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capacity of a computer or a robot controlled by a computer to do activities that normally require human intelligence and judgement. The phrase is widely used to refer to a project aimed at creating systems with human-like cognitive abilities, such as the capacity to reason, discern meaning, generalise, and learn from prior experiences.</p>
<h2> Types of AI </h2>

<h3 style="color:#00998E"> Reactive Machines</h3>
<p style="color:#00998E"> The most basic sort of AI is the reactive machine. It can only react to current events and cannot make judgments based on previously learned or recalled info. Reactive machines don't use maps or other types of pre-planning at all, instead focusing on real-time observations of their surroundings. They are given certain tasks and are limited to those responsibilities. They're what you're most likely to see when you see a robot playing a game against a human, such as chess. Reactive machines, on the other hand, do not interact with the world, therefore they respond to similar events in the same way each time they meet them.</p>

<h3 style="color:#00A343"> Limited Memory </h3>
<p style="color:#00A343"> In the subject of artificial intelligence, there are several terminologies and definitions, making it difficult to identify categories from subsets or kinds of artificial intelligence. Machine learning, big data, and natural language processing are all subsets of AI, but this essay will focus on only one: limited memory artificial intelligence. Reactive machines, theory of mind, and self-awareness are examples of other AI categories. Machine learning models with limited memory derive knowledge from previously learned information, facts, stored data, or events. Limited memory machines, unlike reactive machines, may learn from the past by analysing actions or data supplied to them with the goal of accumulating probationary knowledge.</p>

<h3  style="color:#E55C00">  Theory Of Mind </h3>
<p style="color:#E55C00">Mind-Body Theory Artificial intelligence-powered systems will be able to simulate the outcomes of their activities. Humans will be more communicative with a robot or system driven by Theory of Mind AI. For example, unlike the present generation of AI, such robots/systems will be able to justify their behaviours. Theory of Mind AI will be made up of machine learning systems that can explain their judgments in human-friendly terms.</p>

<h3 style="color:#C7CF00"> Self aware </h3>
<p style="color:#C7CF00">The ultimate level of AI involves computers that are aware of themselves and can comprehend their own internal states as well as the emotions, behaviours, and intelligence of others. This AI has yet to be fully developed, but if it does, we will undoubtedly see a robot with human-level consciousness and intellect.</p>
