<h3>What Do Famous People Think About AI</h3>
<h4>Elon musk</h4>
At a National Governors Association summer meeting, Musk communicated to the attendees and expressed that he knows, “I keeps sounding the alarm bell, but until people see robots going down the street killing people, they don’t know how to react because it seems so ethereal.” One of his statements included that “we need to be super careful with AI as they are potentially more dangerous than nukes”. He also recommends being proactive in regulation than reactive.
<h4>Sundar pichai </h4>
Sundar Pichai, chief executive of the tech company, believes that AI will fundamentally change how we live our lives and will transform healthcare, education and manufacturing. The Google boss warned that the development of AI was still in its very early stages but added: “I view it as the most profound technology that humanity will ever develop and work on.”
 
<h4>Jeff bezos</h4>
 Bezos said artificial intelligence will improve the quality of jobs. “Humans like to do things and we like to be productive and we will figure outhings to do and we will use these tools to make ourselves more powerful,” he said. “What I predict is that jobs will get more engaging. Because you have to remember, a lot of the jobs today are quite routine.”
<h4>Ratan tata </h4>
“We are confident that the government will introduce a sound new data regulation framework to ensure data privacy,” Ambani said at a global Artificial Intelligence (AI) summit, RAISE 2020, on Monday evening. Data, he said, is the raw material for AI, and intelligent data is digital capital, adding that in coming decades, nations would increasingly compete on digital capital.
 
<h4>Bill gates </h4>
The power of artificial intelligence is “so incredible, it will change society in some very deep ways,” said billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Some ways will be good, some bad, according to Gates.
“The world hasn’t had that many technologies that are both promising and dangerous — you know, we had nuclear energy and nuclear weapons,” Gates said March 18 at the 2019 Human-Centred Artificial Intelligence Symposium at Stanford University
