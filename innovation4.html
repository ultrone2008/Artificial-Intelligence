<p style="margin-left:320px"> The integration of AI and machine learning algorithms into the existing computer systems has invented quantum computing. These advanced computer systems can solve complex problems within a short span of time by utilising quantum bits. Quantum computing also interprets multiple sets of real-time data to predict some meaningful business insights for the upcoming years. AI is transforming those traditional computers into smart, reliable computers.
